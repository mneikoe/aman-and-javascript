/* Data Transformations : map,filter,reduce
these are array methods


MAP-
map is similar to forEach it creates a new array  it basically loop over the array and in each iteration it applies a callback
function which we will define in the map method to the current element of the array
map returns a new array containing the results if applying an operation oon all original array elements.


FILTER-
it used to filter elements based on the specific conditions these conditions are specified by us
filter returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition

REDUCE- 
reduce boils(reduces) all array elements down to one single value. (eg. adding all elements together)
